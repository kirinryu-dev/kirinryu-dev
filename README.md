## Hi there 👋👹 

I'm **Sam Tanguy Tchalim**, a full-stack learner walking the edge between code, testing, and system mastery.  
Currently building up a modular workflow where dev, QA, and DevOps logic blend — one brick at a time.

---

### 💡 What I Do

- 🧩 **Full-Stack Exploration**: HTML/CSS, JS, PHP, and C/C++ — I build without frameworks to master the raw flow.
- 🔍 **QA & Testing**: Learning to break what I build — with purpose.
- ⚙️ **DevOps Curious**: From Git logic to local deployment and environment control.
- 📐 **Workflow Crafter**: Designing my own development method — *Electric Concept* — to structure projects and scale my thinking.

### ⚙️ Currently Focused On

- 🔧 Building solid fundamentals in backend (PHP, C)  
- 🧠 Understanding memory, logic flow, and edge cases  
- 🗂️ Organizing projects with clear structure & purpose  
- 🌩️ Shaping a portfolio that reflects learning, identity, and power

### ✨ Motto  
**“Time + Technique never fails.”**  
I build with intention, and I debug with patience.
